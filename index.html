      <h2>Lions' win over Packers sends message to NFC, and it's because they're good at something they weren't last year</h2>

      <article>
    <p>
      The Detroit Lions are for real. 
      As the wins keep mounting and the performances match the record, 
      its time to take this team seriously. After their 34-20 win over 
      the Packers (and the game wasnt even as close as the score would suggest), 
      theres no question about who is the best team in the NFC North. Its the Lions. 
      The offensive line is overwhelming, theyve found an effective running game 
      combination and Detroit's defense has vastly improved from a season ago.
